There are two files which are 'extract_pn.py' and 'calculate_perm.py' which would allow you to extract PN (1st file) and calculate absolute permability of the sample (2nd file).

1) Segmented images can be downloaded here: http://people.physics.anu.edu.au/~aps110/network_comparison/#measures

2) When extracting PN models from segmented micro-CT images it is important to specify image resolution which is as follows:

Silica sphere pack - 17.472 micrometers
Castlegate sandstone - 5.6 micrometers
Unconsolidated Sand Pack - 9.184 micrometers
Mt Gambier Limestone - 3.024 

3) The dimensions are 512 x 512 x 512 voxels for all the images which is specified

4) .mhd files are created for all the images for ParaView visualisation 

5) Calculated permeability values are as follows:

Silica sphere pack - 6.60867972e-11 m2
Castlegate sandstone - 1.42143728e-12 m2
Unconsolidated Sand Pack - 3.65944467e-11 m2
Gambier Limestone - 2.19280038e-12 m2
