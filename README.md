# mincutPN
This project is dedicated to research the correspondence between absolute permeability of full-size PN models and their minimum cuts.

The project should be treated as a collection of useful scripts gathered in one place.

The project is based on OpenPNM (commit 5f137c70) and Porespy (commit 8045f50).
